                                            <p>Green tea has been consumed in China for more than 2000 years. It is believed to be one of, if not the original form 
                                            of teas. Over the centuries, it has have been purported to have long term health benefits. These benefits have been 
                                            studied intensively in recent years at various health/medical departments.The study of health benefits of tea drinking has also been extended
                                            to other types of teas such as WHITE TEA, YELLOW TEA, OOLONG/WULONG TEA and PU-ERH TEA.</p>
                                            <p>Shennong's Herbal is the first recorded Chinese herb dictionary. It recorded 365 herbs more than 2000 years ago. The herbs were individual 
                                                tasted and tested by Shennong – one of the earliest Chinese herbal pharmacists. The book states: “Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs. He was 
                                                in contact with poisons daily. Regular tea drinking kept him free of sickness and stayed healthy.” The statement summarizes an ancient 
                                                Chinese acknowledgement for teas: a beverage for enjoyment and a herb for health.</p>
